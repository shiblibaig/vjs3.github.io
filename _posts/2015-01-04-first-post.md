title: Welcome to my personal website!
---

I am very exciting to finally write this post and letting everyone know that I have my personal website/blog into the world of internet.I was thinking to have a site from past few months but unable to do so because of several reasons, so in this new year of 2016 finally I decided to buy a domain and having my own website.<br>
Firstly I want to thank **[Dean Attall](http://deanattali.com/)** for making this wonderful and easy to use theme **[beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll)** which helped and motivate me to build my own personal blog.<br>
Now I want to tell why I have been seeking for the personal blog?well I love to read and write blogs a lot and I use to write casually from past 2 years on either **Quora** and some other places but never have a place to showcase what's been in to my mind.<br>
What you guys found here?Well this question has not a definite answer write now but being an **Android Developer** definitely a lot of android content will be there.Also sometimes I might write about opensource technology (yeah!I'm in love with open source from past some time:D), beside that on whatever new technology i will work there will definitely be some stuff about that as well.At last i would randomly write about trvelling(obviously whenever I visit a new place :p), food(still not sure about that but yeah I love trying different foodie stuff ;)) and some random stuff which might happen with me.
Some people might think I have written myself as Entreperenuer but why I didn't mention anything about it?Well the fact is I am too much into Entreprenuership but I consider my self a very inexperienced guy in this area so I prefer more of reading in it :p
