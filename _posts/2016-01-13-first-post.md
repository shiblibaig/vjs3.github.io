title: Welcome to my personal website!
---

I am very excited to finally able to write this post and letting everyone know that I have my personal website/blog into the world of internet.I was thinking to have a site from past few months but unable to do so because of several reasons, so in this new year of 2016 finally I decided to buy a domain and having my own website.<br>

Now why I have been seeking for the personal blog?well I love to read and write blogs a lot and I use to write casually from past 2 years on either **Quora** and some other places but never have a place of my own to showcase what's been in to my mind.Also its a great way to showcase my projects and portfolio :wink:<br>

What I will write in here?Well this question has not a definite answer right now but being an **Android Developer** definitely a lot of android content will be there.Also sometimes I might write about opensource technology (yeah!I'm in love with open source from past some time :smile:), beside that on whatever new technology I will work there will definitely be some stuff about that as well.At last I would randomly write about trvelling(obviously whenever I visit a new place :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:), food(still not sure about that but yeah I love trying different foodie stuff :wink:), books that I read (I have started reading some awesome books in the recent past) and some random stuff which might happen with me.<br>

Some people might think I have written myself as Entreperenuer but why I didn't mention anything about it?Well the fact is I am too much into Entreprenuership but I consider myself a very inexperienced guy in this area so I prefer more of reading in it :p but I will definitely write about it as soon as something good came into my mind.

Lastly I want to thank **[Dean Attall](http://deanattali.com/)** for making this wonderful and easy to use theme **[beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll)** which helped and motivate me to build my own personal blog.Dude this is a great theme, being a mobile developer i have minimal knowledge of web development but this theme is super awesome for people like us.Also I learned a lot during building this blog specially what awesome things can be done with **Markdown**.<br>

At the end I want myself to end this post by promising myself that i will hopefully keep writing amazing stuff in here without being lazy :grin:
